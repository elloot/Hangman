# Hangman
## How the game works
### Picking a word
A word that will be guessed is picked by either a computer or a person. This word is represented by a row of dashes, each dash representing a letter of the word.
### Guessing
If the guesser guesses a letter that is part of the chosen word, the other player writes in the letter in all its correct positions in the word. If the suggested letter is wrong, the other player draws one part of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. If the game is played against a computer, these actions are carried out by said computer.
### Winning/losing

## Gamemodes
Hangman can be played against a computer or against a friend. When playing against a computer, a word is picked randomly from a list and the player is then allowed to guess letters in the word until they get it right or run out of guesses. Playing against a friend works the same as playing against a computer except that either you or your friend can input a word of your own to guess.
